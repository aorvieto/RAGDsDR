# Practical Accelerated Optimization on Riemannian Manifolds

# Code for ICML 2020

We develop a new Riemannian descent algorithmwith an accelerated rate of convergence.  We fo-cus on functions that are geodesically convex andweakly-quasi-convex which are weaker functionclasses compared to prior work that has consid-ered geodesically strongly-convex functions. Ourproof of convergence relies on a novel estimatesequence which allows us to demonstrate the de-pendency of the convergence rate on the curva-ture of the manifold.
